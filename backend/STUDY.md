## 1. Introduction to Digital Signal Processing {#introduction}

Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is the mathematical manipulation of digital signals to extract meaningful information. In our gender classification system, we use DSP to analyze speech signals and extract features that differ between male and female voices.

### Why DSP for Gender Classification?

Human voices have distinct acoustic properties that correlate with gender:
- **Anatomical differences**: Male vocal tracts are typically longer, vocal folds are thicker
- **Physiological differences**: Different fundamental frequencies, formant patterns
- **Acoustic manifestations**: These translate to measurable signal characteristics

### Our Multi-Feature Approach

Instead of relying on a single feature, we combine multiple DSP features with weighted importance:
- **F0 (40% weight)**: Primary gender indicator
- **Spectral Centroid (25% weight)**: Voice brightness
- **Formants (20% weight)**: Vocal tract resonances
- **MFCC (10% weight)**: Vocal tract shape
- **HNR (5% weight)**: Voice quality

## 2. Audio Signal Fundamentals {#audio-fundamentals}

### Digital Audio Representation

Audio signals are continuous waveforms that we convert to discrete digital samples:

```
Continuous Signal: x(t) → Sampled Signal: x[n] = x(nT)
```

Where:
- `T = 1/fs` (sampling period)
- `fs` = sampling frequency (we use 16kHz)
- `n` = sample index

### Nyquist Theorem

To avoid aliasing, we must sample at least twice the highest frequency:
```
fs ≥ 2 × fmax
```

For speech (up to ~8kHz), 16kHz sampling is sufficient.

### Time-Domain vs Frequency-Domain

**Time Domain**: Shows amplitude changes over time
- Good for: Temporal patterns, energy analysis
- Limited for: Frequency content analysis

**Frequency Domain**: Shows frequency components and their magnitudes
- Good for: Spectral analysis, filtering, feature extraction
- Obtained via: Fourier Transform

---

## 3. Feature Extraction Pipeline {#feature-extraction}

Our feature extraction follows this pipeline:

```
Raw Audio → Preprocessing → Feature Extraction → Classification
     ↓              ↓               ↓              ↓
  Load/Trim → Remove Silence → Extract Features → Weighted Scoring
```

### Preprocessing Steps

1. **Audio Loading**: Convert to mono, resample to 16kHz
2. **Silence Trimming**: Remove quiet sections (top_db=20)
3. **Validation**: Ensure non-empty signal

```python
y, sr = librosa.load(audio_path, sr=16000)
y = librosa.effects.trim(y, top_db=20)[0]
```

---

## 4. Fundamental Frequency (F0) Analysis {#f0-analysis}

### What is F0?

The fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency component of a periodic waveform. For voiced speech, it corresponds to the vocal fold vibration rate.

### Gender Differences in F0

**Typical Ranges:**
- **Adult Males**: 85-180 Hz (average ~120 Hz)
- **Adult Females**: 165-265 Hz (average ~210 Hz)
- **Children**: 250-400 Hz

### F0 Detection Methods

We implement multiple methods for robustness:

#### 1. YIN Algorithm
The YIN algorithm uses autocorrelation with improvements:

```python
f0_yin = librosa.yin(y, fmin=50, fmax=500, sr=sr)
```

**How YIN Works:**
1. Compute difference function: `d[τ] = Σ(x[j] - x[j+τ])²`
2. Apply cumulative mean normalization
3. Find minimum that represents the period
4. Convert period to frequency: `f0 = sr/period`

#### 2. Piptrack (Pitch Tracking)
Uses spectral peaks and harmonic relationships:

```python
pitches, magnitudes = librosa.piptrack(y=y, sr=sr, threshold=0.1)
```

**Process:**
1. Compute STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform)
2. Identify spectral peaks
3. Track harmonic relationships
4. Extract fundamental frequency

#### 3. Autocorrelation Fallback
When other methods fail, we use time-domain autocorrelation:

```python
autocorr = correlate(y_mid, y_mid, mode='full')
```

**Theory:**
- Autocorrelation measures signal similarity with delayed versions
- Periodic signals show peaks at multiples of the period
- Find the first significant peak to determine F0

### F0 Classification Logic

```python
if f0_mean <= 120:    # Very deep male
    f0_score = 0.9
elif f0_mean <= 150:  # Typical male
    f0_score = 0.6
elif f0_mean <= 170:  # Low male/deep female
    f0_score = 0.3
# ... continues with female ranges
```

---

## 5. Spectral Analysis Techniques {#spectral-analysis}

### Fourier Transform Fundamentals

The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) converts time-domain signals to frequency-domain:

```
X[k] = Σ(n=0 to N-1) x[n] * e^(-j2πkn/N)
```

Where:
- `X[k]` = frequency domain representation
- `x[n]` = time domain samples
- `k` = frequency bin index
- `N` = number of samples

### Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

FFT is an efficient algorithm to compute DFT:
- **Complexity**: O(N log N) vs O(N²) for direct DFT
- **Implementation**: Uses divide-and-conquer approach
- **Usage in our code**: `np.fft.rfft(y)` for real signals

### Spectral Centroid

The spectral centroid indicates the "center of mass" of the spectrum:

```
Centroid = Σ(f[k] * |X[k]|²) / Σ(|X[k]|²)
```

**Physical Interpretation:**
- **Lower centroid**: Darker, more bass-heavy sound (typically male)
- **Higher centroid**: Brighter, more treble-heavy sound (typically female)

**Our Classification Ranges:**
```python
if spectral_centroid < 1600:   # Dark = male
    sc_score = 0.6
elif spectral_centroid < 2000: # Somewhat dark = lean male
    sc_score = 0.3
elif spectral_centroid < 2400: # Neutral
    sc_score = 0.0
elif spectral_centroid < 2800: # Bright = lean female
    sc_score = -0.3
else:                          # Very bright = female
    sc_score = -0.6
```

### Spectral Rolloff

Spectral rolloff is the frequency below which a specified percentage (usually 85%) of the total spectral energy lies:

```python
rolloff = librosa.feature.spectral_rolloff(y=y, sr=sr)[0]
```

**Gender Correlation:**
- Lower rolloff → More energy in low frequencies → Typically male
- Higher rolloff → More energy distributed across spectrum → Typically female

---

## 6. Formant Analysis {#formant-analysis}

### What are Formants?

Formants are resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. They represent the frequency bands where the vocal tract amplifies sound.

### Vocal Tract Physics

The vocal tract acts as a tube resonator:
- **Length**: Affects formant frequencies (longer tube = lower formants)
- **Shape**: Affects formant bandwidths and relative amplitudes
- **Gender differences**: Males typically have longer vocal tracts

### Typical Formant Values

**Adult Males:**
- F1: 300-600 Hz (tongue height)
- F2: 900-1300 Hz (tongue backness)
- F3: 2200-2800 Hz (lip rounding)

**Adult Females:**
- F1: 400-800 Hz
- F2: 1300-2100 Hz
- F3: 2800-3500 Hz

### Our Formant Estimation Method

We use spectral peak detection instead of traditional LPC (Linear Predictive Coding):

```python
# Get power spectrum
fft = np.fft.rfft(y)
magnitude = np.abs(fft)
freq_bins = np.fft.rfftfreq(len(y), 1/sr)

# Smooth spectrum to find broad peaks
smoothed_magnitude = savgol_filter(magnitude, 51, 3)

# Find peaks in formant range (200-4000 Hz)
peaks, properties = find_peaks(formant_mags, 
                              height=np.max(formant_mags) * 0.1, 
                              distance=50)
```

**Why This Approach:**
1. **Simplicity**: Avoids complex LPC analysis
2. **Robustness**: Works with various voice qualities
3. **Speed**: Faster than iterative LPC methods

### Formant Classification Logic

```python
if f1 < 450 and f2 < 1200:     # Low formants = male
    formant_score = 0.7
elif f1 < 550 and f2 < 1400:   # Somewhat low = lean male
    formant_score = 0.4
elif f1 > 650 and f2 > 1600:   # High formants = female
    formant_score = -0.7
elif f1 > 550 and f2 > 1400:   # Somewhat high = lean female
    formant_score = -0.4
```

## 7. MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) {#mfcc}

### What are MFCCs?

MFCCs represent the spectral envelope of audio signals in a way that mimics human auditory perception.

### The MFCC Computation Process

1. **Pre-emphasis**: High-pass filter to balance spectrum
2. **Windowing**: Apply window function (usually Hamming)
3. **FFT**: Convert to frequency domain
4. **Mel Filter Bank**: Apply perceptually-motivated filters
5. **Logarithm**: Compress dynamic range
6. **DCT**: Decorrelate coefficients

### Mel Scale

The Mel scale approximates human auditory perception:

```
mel(f) = 2595 * log10(1 + f/700)
```

**Why Mel Scale:**
- Human hearing is more sensitive to changes at lower frequencies
- Equal distances on Mel scale correspond to equal perceptual distances

### MFCC Filter Bank

Triangular filters spaced on the Mel scale:
- **Number of filters**: Typically 26-40
- **Frequency range**: Usually 0 Hz to Nyquist frequency
- **Shape**: Triangular, overlapping

### Cepstral Analysis

The cepstrum is the "spectrum of the spectrum":

```
Cepstrum = IFFT(log(|FFT(signal)|))
```

**Why Cepstral Analysis:**
- Separates spectral envelope from fine structure
- First few coefficients capture vocal tract shape
- Higher coefficients capture pitch and noise

### Our MFCC Implementation

```python
mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=13)
for i in range(min(5, mfccs.shape[0])):
    features[f'mfcc_{i}_mean'] = float(np.mean(mfccs[i]))
    features[f'mfcc_{i}_std'] = float(np.std(mfccs[i]))
```

### MFCC Gender Classification

```python
# MFCC coefficients tend to be different for male/female
if mfcc_1_mean < -20:      # Lower MFCC1 often indicates male
    mfcc_score += 0.3
elif mfcc_1_mean > -10:    # Higher MFCC1 often indicates female
    mfcc_score -= 0.3

if mfcc_2_mean > 10:       # Higher MFCC2 variation
    mfcc_score -= 0.2      # Often female
elif mfcc_2_mean < 0:
    mfcc_score += 0.2      # Often male
```

**Interpretation:**
- **MFCC1**: Related to spectral tilt and overall brightness
- **MFCC2**: Related to spectral shape and formant structure
- **Gender patterns**: Statistical differences in vocal tract characteristics

---

## 8. Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio (HNR) {#hnr}

### Definition

HNR measures the ratio of harmonic (periodic) energy to noise (aperiodic) energy in a signal.

### Calculation Method

We use harmonic-percussive separation:

```python
harmonic, percussive = librosa.effects.hpss(y)
harmonic_power = np.mean(harmonic**2)
noise_power = np.mean((y - harmonic)**2)
hnr_db = 10 * np.log10(harmonic_power / noise_power)
```

### Gender Correlation

**Typical Values:**
- **Males**: Often slightly lower HNR (10-15 dB)
- **Females**: Often slightly higher HNR (12-18 dB)

**Physical Reasons:**
- Vocal fold mass and tension differences
- Airflow patterns during phonation
- Voice quality variations

### Classification Logic

```python
if hnr < 10:        # Lower HNR = lean male
    hnr_score = 0.3
elif hnr > 18:      # Higher HNR = lean female
    hnr_score = -0.3
```

## 9. Filtering and Preprocessing {#filtering}

### Digital Filters

Digital filters modify the frequency content of signals. We implement several types:

#### 1. Low-Pass Filters
Allow low frequencies, attenuate high frequencies:

```
H(z) = Y(z)/X(z)
```

**Use cases:**
- Anti-aliasing before downsampling
- Noise reduction
- Bandwidth limiting

#### 2. High-Pass Filters
Allow high frequencies, attenuate low frequencies:

**Use cases:**
- Remove DC offset
- Eliminate low-frequency noise
- Emphasize speech content

#### 3. Band-Pass Filters
Allow frequencies within a specific range:

**Our telephone bandwidth filter:**
- Low cutoff: 300 Hz
- High cutoff: 3400 Hz
- Simulates telephone channel characteristics

### Filter Design

We use Butterworth filters for their flat passband response:

```python
from scipy.signal import butter, filtfilt

def butter_bandpass(lowcut, highcut, fs, order=5):
    nyq = 0.5 * fs
    low = lowcut / nyq
    high = highcut / nyq
    b, a = butter(order, [low, high], btype='band')
    return b, a
```

### Filter Implementation

```python
b, a = butter_bandpass(low_cutoff, high_cutoff, sr, order)
filtered_signal = filtfilt(b, a, signal)
```

**Why `filtfilt`:**
- Zero-phase filtering (no time delay)
- Forward and backward filtering
- Doubles the effective filter order

### Frequency Response

The frequency response shows how a filter affects different frequencies:

```
H(ω) = |H(ω)| * e^(jφ(ω))
```

Where:
- `|H(ω)|` = magnitude response
- `φ(ω)` = phase response

---

## 10. Classification Strategy {#classification}

### Multi-Feature Weighted Scoring

Instead of simple thresholding, we use a sophisticated scoring system:

```python
# Feature weights (sum to 1.0)
weights = {
    'f0': 0.4,           # Most reliable
    'spectral_centroid': 0.25,  # Voice brightness
    'formants': 0.2,     # Vocal tract
    'mfcc': 0.1,         # Detailed shape
    'hnr': 0.05          # Voice quality
}
```

### Scoring Function

Each feature contributes a score between -1 (female) and +1 (male):

```python
weighted_score = Σ(feature_score[i] * weight[i])
```

### Probability Conversion

We use a sigmoid function to convert scores to probabilities:

```python
sigmoid_factor = 4
male_prob = 1 / (1 + exp(-sigmoid_factor * weighted_score))
female_prob = 1.0 - male_prob
```

**Why Sigmoid:**
- Smooth probability transition
- Bounded between 0 and 1
- Handles extreme scores gracefully

### Decision Logic

```python
if abs(male_prob - female_prob) < 0.1:  # Ambiguous
    predicted_gender = "unknown"
    confidence = 0.5
elif male_prob > female_prob:
    predicted_gender = "male"
    confidence = male_prob
else:
    predicted_gender = "female"
    confidence = female_prob
```

---

## 11. Mathematical Foundations {#mathematical-foundations}

### Complex Numbers in DSP

Many DSP operations use complex numbers:

```
z = a + jb = r * e^(jθ)
```

Where:
- `r = |z| = √(a² + b²)` (magnitude)
- `θ = atan2(b, a)` (phase)

### Euler's Formula

```
e^(jθ) = cos(θ) + j*sin(θ)
```

This is fundamental to the Fourier Transform.

### Convolution

Convolution describes the output of a linear system:

```
y[n] = Σ(k=-∞ to ∞) x[k] * h[n-k]
```

**Frequency Domain:**
```
Y(ω) = X(ω) * H(ω)
```

Convolution in time ↔ Multiplication in frequency

### Window Functions

Windows reduce spectral leakage in FFT analysis:

**Hamming Window:**
```
w[n] = 0.54 - 0.46 * cos(2πn/(N-1))
```

**Hann Window:**
```
w[n] = 0.5 * (1 - cos(2πn/(N-1)))
```

### Statistical Measures

We use various statistical measures:

**Mean:** `μ = (1/N) * Σx[n]`

**Standard Deviation:** `σ = √((1/N) * Σ(x[n] - μ)²)`

**Median:** Middle value when sorted

## 12. Practical Implementation {#implementation}

### Code Structure

Our implementation follows this hierarchy:

```
extract_audio_features(audio_path)
├── Load and preprocess audio
├── F0 detection (multiple methods)
├── Spectral analysis (centroid, rolloff)
├── MFCC computation
├── Formant estimation
└── HNR calculation

classify_gender(features)
├── Feature scoring
├── Weight normalization
├── Probability calculation
└── Decision making
```

### Error Handling

We implement robust error handling:

```python
try:
    # Primary method (YIN)
    f0_yin = librosa.yin(y, fmin=50, fmax=500, sr=sr)
except:
    try:
        # Fallback method (piptrack)
        pitches, magnitudes = librosa.piptrack(...)
    except:
        # Last resort (autocorrelation)
        autocorr = correlate(y_mid, y_mid, mode='full')
```

### Performance Considerations

**Computational Complexity:**
- FFT: O(N log N)
- MFCC: O(N log N) for FFT + filter operations
- Autocorrelation: O(N²) naive, O(N log N) with FFT

**Memory Usage:**
- Store only necessary intermediate results
- Use in-place operations where possible
- Clean up temporary files

### Debugging and Logging

Comprehensive logging helps understand the classification process:

```python
logger.info(f"=== MULTI-FEATURE GENDER CLASSIFICATION ===")
for feature_name, details in feature_details.items():
    logger.info(f"{feature_name}: {details}")
logger.info(f"Final weighted score: {weighted_score:.3f}")
```

---

## Conclusion

This gender classification system demonstrates the power of combining multiple DSP techniques:

1. **F0 Analysis**: Captures fundamental voice characteristics
2. **Spectral Analysis**: Reveals frequency distribution patterns
3. **Formant Analysis**: Reflects vocal tract resonances
4. **MFCC**: Provides perceptually-relevant spectral envelope
5. **HNR**: Indicates voice quality differences

The weighted combination of these features provides robust classification that works even when individual features fail or are ambiguous. The mathematical foundations ensure accurate signal processing, while the implementation handles real-world challenges like noise and varying audio quality.

Understanding these concepts enables you to:
- Modify feature weights for different applications
- Add new features or improve existing ones
- Debug classification issues
- Adapt the system for other audio classification tasks

The key insight is that gender classification is not about finding a single "magic" feature, but rather about combining multiple complementary features in a principled way that reflects the underlying physics of speech production.
